## Feats/Goals in persist.ml:

- Testing phase: Test if sound can be executed by a webpage after certain interval?...

1. Continuity: continue 5 minutes break automaticaly after 30 sec relax break on a full pomodoro completion.
2. Add sound test button in the app.
3. Add a +5 mins button which can be used dynamically only i.e., only if either break time or pomodoro time is running.
   [x] 4. Remove the hassel of everytime setting the timer of 5 mins and 25 mins sometimes.
4. After 3 pomodoros it should set a break time of 25 minutes automatically so as to follow pomodoro principles and then again work for same like 3 regular pomodoros, yo!
5. Setting button to allow changing default pomodoro, default break time and default break time.
6. Add a label option there as well.
